We are a duo of experienced smart contract security researchers. Having audited 20+ protocols, won multiple competitions, and ranked in the top spots of many others, we've built solid, battle-tested expertise in various DeFi protocols, including lending, staking, DEXes, governance, cross-chain, Eigenlayer integrations (LRTs), SocialFi, and more.

Having worked together for the past two years — initially as web3 developers and now as security researchers — we are a brilliantly organized team capable of delivering results efficiently and reliably on any assignment we undertake.
